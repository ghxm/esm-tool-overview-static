Samply supports experience sampling, ambulatory assessment and diary studies. We want to make sending notifications to participants an easy and comfortable task for researchers. The main idea is that you as a researcher are free to use any tool to create an online survey or an experiment. Samply sends mobile notifications through the Samply mobile application, so when participants of your study click on the notification, they open your online study in a mobile web-browser.

## Features

- Samply is free, there is no hidden costs (thanks to the generous support of the iScience group)
- Native mobile application for participants available in Google Play or App Store.
- Different types of notifications schedule (one-time, repeat, user-dependent, randomized).
- Customization of messages and URL links that you send to participants.
- Recording participants' responses to your notifications.
